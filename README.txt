The default Android browser currently can't read HTML files from the SD card.  I needed an app that could, so I wrote this one.

It supports HTML, TXT, and PDF (assuming you already have a PDF reader app).

This app is very simple and has barely any features.  If you'd like to make it better, check out the homepage!
